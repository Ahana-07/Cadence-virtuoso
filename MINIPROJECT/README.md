## Project Flow

### 1Ô∏è. Schematic Design
- Designed a **2-input CMOS AND gate** using **PMOS** and **NMOS** transistors.
- Connected the transistors in series/parallel according to CMOS AND logic implementation.
- Verified circuit connectivity.

### 2Ô∏è. Symbol Creation
- Created a symbol for the AND gate to use it as a block in higher-level designs.
- The symbol has **two inputs (A, B)** and **one output (Y)**.

### 3Ô∏è.Transient Analysis
- Simulated the AND gate using the **Spectre Simulator**.
- Applied different combinations of logic inputs and observed the output waveform.
- Verified correct logical operation: Output is HIGH only when both inputs are HIGH.

### 4Ô∏è. Layout Design
- Created the physical layout of the AND gate according to **45nm design rules**.
- Used **poly**, **metal layers**, **diffusion**, and **contacts** according to PDK guidelines.
- Performed **DRC** to ensure design rule compliance.
- Performed **LVS** to match layout with schematic.

## Results
- **DRC Status:**  Passed (No design rule violations)
- **LVS Status:**  Matched (Layout matches schematic)
- **Functionality:** Verified correct AND gate behavior in simulation.

## Conclusion
- Successfully designed a **2-input AND gate** in **Cadence Virtuoso (180nm)**.
- Verified the design through **schematic simulation**, **layout verification**, and **waveform analysis**.
- The project demonstrates the **full custom VLSI design flow** for a basic logic gate.
