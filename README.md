# Cadence-virtuoso

A collection of basic logic gate desgins, combinational and sequential ciruits implemented and simulated using Cadence Virtuoso with the GPDK045 PDK.

## Overview
This repository includes the Schematic , Symbol and Transient analysis of the following 
### Logic Gates 
AND,OR,NOT,NAND,XOR,NOR,XNOR
### Combinational circuits
Half adder, Full adder,MUX,DEMUX,Encoder,Decoder,Half subtractor,Full subtractor
### Sequential circuits
SR FlipFlop , JK FlipFlop , D FlipFlop 

## Tools Used
-Cadence Virtuoso 
- GPD045 PDK (Generic 45nm CMOS Process Design Kit)
- Linux environment(Red Hat)

## Notes
-All ciruits are verified using transient analysis to validate logicial behaviour.
-Symbols are created for modular hierarchical design.
